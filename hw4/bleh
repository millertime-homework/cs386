1. first Q is joining teamrel and agent on agent id, meaning it will not produce a row
for agents that aren't on a team. the second Q has an inner query that just groups all
team ids, and an outer query that selects from every agent, so it will produce rows of
agents on 0 teams.

These queries both list the name of an agent and the number of teams that agent is on.

2. first Q is joining team and mission on team id, meaning it will not produce a row
for teams that are not on any missions. the second Q has an inner query that just groups
all team ids, and an outer query that selects from every team, so it is capable of
producing rows of teams that are on 0 missions, despite there being no 0-mission teams
currently.

These queries both list the name of a team and the number of missions that team is on.

3. They would be equivalent if mission.team_id had a NOT NULL constraint, because
right now the second query is able to show missions that have no teams on them, but
the first query can only find missions that have teams on them. with NOT NULL
constraining mission.team_id there has to be a team on every mission.

These queries both list mission names and ids, along with how many teams are on that mission.
